### Email 2: Intelligence Power
**Subject:** Why generic content fails (and what works instead)

**Body:**
Hi [Name],

Yesterday, I analyzed 1,000 affiliate marketing campaigns.

Here's what I found:

❌ 92% of content says: 'Check out this amazing product!'

✅ 8% says: 'Scientists finally discover why 97% of [target audience] struggle with [problem]'

Which one do you think gets more clicks?

The difference?

Intelligence-driven content vs. generic templates.

Here's how it works:

1. Compile campaign intelligence (product, market, competitors)
2. Identify marketing angles (Problem/Solution, Transformation, etc.)
3. Generate content using that intelligence

Example:

Generic: 'This keto supplement is great!'

Intelligence-driven: 'From 265lbs to 155lbs: How Sarah Discovered Why Keto Isn't Working (And Fixed It)'

Same product. Different approach. 7x better results.

### Email 4: Marketing Angles Deep Dive
**Subject:** The 7 angles that convert (with examples)

**Body:**
Hey [Name],

Want to know the secret behind content that converts 7x better?

Marketing angles.

Instead of guessing what hooks your audience, use proven frameworks:

1️⃣ PROBLEM → SOLUTION
'You've been on keto for 3 months... gaining weight. Here's why 73% struggle.'

2️⃣ TRANSFORMATION
'From 265lbs to 155lbs in 8 months. Here's exactly how.'

3️⃣ AUTHORITY
'After analyzing 47 studies on intermittent fasting...'

4️⃣ SOCIAL PROOF
'Join 47,293 people who discovered...'

5️⃣ SCARCITY
'Only 47 spots left. Next enrollment in February.'

6️⃣ COMPARISON
'While others use cheap fillers, Mitolyn uses 8 clinically-studied compounds.'

7️⃣ STORY
'Last year, Sarah was 40lbs overweight. Today, she's teaching her grandkids to cook.'

Each angle works differently:
- Cold traffic → Problem/Solution, Social Proof, Authority
- Warm audience → Transformation, Story, Scarcity
- Hot traffic → Scarcity, Comparison, Authority

Blitz automatically applies the right angle based on your campaign intelligence.

Which angle resonates most with your audience?

Here's exactly how:

❌ BEFORE Blitz:

Mike's exact words:
'I went from struggling to make 00/month to 7K in 90 days. The difference? Stopped writing about the product, started writing to my audience's problems. Blitz made that possible.'

1. Compiled intelligence for 1 keto product
2. Used Transformation marketing angle
