Project: Blitz — Modular SaaS for Affiliate Marketers
Backend: FastAPI + PostgreSQL (Railway)
Frontend: Next.js (Vercel)
Date: 2025-10-27

## Executive Summary

Blitz is a modular SaaS to help affiliate marketers research products, compile market intelligence, and generate compliant promotional content. The backend is FastAPI with PostgreSQL and Alembic, the frontend is planned in Next.js (Phase 4). Core concepts include a three-stage intelligence pipeline (extraction → AI enhancement → RAG retrieval), modular services, and cost-optimized AI routing.

This handover summarizes the current state, fixes completed in this session (CORS, async DB queries, auth/JWT and bcrypt issues), and outlines the next steps for Admin and User dashboards.

---

## 1) Architecture Overview

- Backend: FastAPI, SQLAlchemy (async), Alembic, Pydantic, Uvicorn
- Database: PostgreSQL (Railway)
- Storage: Cloudflare R2 (planned/implemented service)
- AI/RAG: Provider-agnostic AI router, Cohere embeddings, RAG vector storage/service, Prompt Builder, Compliance Checker
- Frontend: Next.js 14 (Vercel) — to be implemented in Phase 4

Core principles:

- Modular services (intelligence, content, compliance, RAG)
- Request-scoped DI via FastAPI Depends
- No hardcoded templates/mock data
- Flexible affiliate network inputs (ClickBank, JVZoo, WarriorPlus)
- Compliance-first (FTC)

---

## 2) Files Referenced/Uploaded

- endpoints.json
- frontend_files.txt
- backend_files.txt
- requirements.txt
- settings.py
- main.py
- session.py
- auth.py
- HANDOVER_DOCUMENT.md (this document)
- HANDOVER_FIX_REGISTRAION.md — these documents can only be used in code execution
  - Possible extraction failure reasons: binary/unsupported encoding, mislabeled format, or obstructive formatting. If needed, parse via a Python code execution step to read bytes and decode.

Key takeaways from earlier artifacts:

- Three-stage intelligence pipeline
- RAG is central to context generation
- endpoints.json metadata is fine for OpenAPI
- SQLAlchemy model “metadata” field must be renamed to “meta_data”

---

## 3) Backend Status — Completed Components

Dependencies:

- requirements.txt includes FastAPI, SQLAlchemy async, Alembic, Uvicorn, httpx, BS4, Cohere, email-validator, etc.
- Pin bcrypt and passlib versions for compatibility:
  - passlib[bcrypt]==1.7.4
  - bcrypt==4.1.2

Config/DB:

- settings.py (pydantic-settings) loads Railway env vars.
- app/db/session.py provides async engine + `get_db` dependency.
- Alembic configured for async engine and autogenerate.

Core services:

- storage_r2.py (Cloudflare R2 abstraction)
- ai_router.py (provider routing + fallback)
- embeddings.py (Cohere)
- crawler.py (CrawlerService via httpx + BeautifulSoup)
- rag.py (ingestion, vector search, retrieval)
- intelligence_compiler.py (aggregate product/market intel)
- prompt_builder.py (prompt structures)
- compliance_checker.py (FTC checks, issues/score)

APIs and schemas:

- schemas.py (Pydantic DTOs)
- api/auth.py (register, login, me)
- api/campaigns.py (campaign CRUD/analytics)
- api/content.py (generate, list, refine, variations, delete)
- api/intelligence.py (compile intelligence, KB CRUD, RAG query)
- api/compliance.py (compliance checks)
- main.py (app assembly, routers, CORS, middleware)

Deployment:

- railway.json, Procfile
- README oriented to Railway env vars (no .env at runtime)

## 4) Fixes in This Session

1) CORS and 500 masking CORS

- CORS middleware configured early with `allow_origins` including:
  - <https://blitz-frontend-three.vercel.app>
  - <http://localhost:3000>
  - <http://localhost:5173>
- OPTIONS preflight now returns 200.
- 500 errors previously masked CORS; with proper error handling and logging, headers are applied consistently.

2) Async SQLAlchemy queries

- Replaced `db.query(...)` usage with async-aware `select(...)` + `await db.execute(...)` patterns in auth and related modules.

3) Password hashing and bcrypt

- Avoid `bcrypt_sha256` scheme conflicts and version detection errors.
- Use passlib[bcrypt]==1.7.4 and bcrypt==4.1.2.
- Enforce bcrypt's 72-byte limit for plaintext passwords and minimum length.

4) JWT/Settings mismatch

- settings.py defines `JWT_SECRET_KEY` and `JWT_ALGORITHM`. Updated auth to use these exact keys instead of `SECRET_KEY`.
- Login now works after aligning to `JWT_SECRET_KEY`.

5) requirements.txt normalization

- Explicit bcrypt pin and added `python-dateutil` (optional but helpful).
- Example block:
  - passlib[bcrypt]==1.7.4
  - bcrypt==4.1.2

---

## 5) Alembic Notes

- alembic/env.py configured for async engine:
  - Converts `postgresql://` → `postgresql+asyncpg://`
  - Uses `Base.metadata` for autogenerate
- Typical workflow:
  - `alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Initial"`
  - `alembic upgrade head`
  - `alembic current`
- Ensure Railway DATABASE_URL variables are set and migrations are applied.

---

## 6) Environment & Deployment

- All secrets/config via Railway environment variables
- Procfile uses uvicorn on 0.0.0.0:8080
- CORS configured in app/main.py
- Logging: request and processing-time middleware

---

## 7) Next Steps — Phase 4 Frontend

Admin Dashboard (role: admin):

- Overview KPIs (users, campaigns, assets, compliance issues), recent activity
- Users: list/search, role update, activate/deactivate
- Campaigns: list/filter, inspect details
- Intelligence jobs: status, retry/abort, logs
- Compliance issues: list by severity/state, review workflow
- System settings: read-only visibility of non-secret flags; secrets managed via Railway

User Dashboard (role: user):

- Overview: my campaigns, recent content, compliance trend
- Campaigns: create/edit/delete; trigger intelligence; view results
- Content: generate/refine/variations/delete
- Compliance: see issues with suggested fixes
- Knowledge Base: manage sources and re-ingest
- Account: profile, change password

Auth Frontend:

- Use JWT bearer with secure storage strategy (prefer memory + refresh flow or HTTP-only cookie if you add a session endpoint)
- Protect routes based on role

Long-running jobs:

- Polling for job status initially; consider SSE/webhooks later

---

## 8) Open Questions

- Roles: Which roles exist? Is `role` stored on User (e.g., 'user', 'admin') and do new signups default to 'user'?
- Exact models/schemas: Please confirm fields for User, Campaign, Content, ComplianceIssue, IntelligenceJob, KnowledgeBase.
- Admin endpoints: Do you want `/api/admin/...` routes created for user/campaign/compliance/job management?
- UI/UX: Preferred UI library (Tailwind + Headless UI vs MUI/AntD)? Branding/colors? Single app with role-based routes or separate admin subdomain?

---

## 9) Files Helpful to Share Next

Backend (to finalize APIs and types):

- app/db/models.py (or modules where entities are defined)
- app/schemas.py
- app/api/campaigns.py
- app/api/content.py
- app/api/intelligence.py
- app/api/compliance.py
- any existing admin routes (e.g., app/api/admin/*.py)
- app/services/rag.py, app/services/intelligence_compiler.py, app/services/compliance_checker.py

Frontend:

- Any existing Next.js scaffold; if none, I’ll propose a full file tree and initial pages.

Config:

- Confirm User fields: role, is_active, created_at, last_login_at.

---

## 10) Quick Commands

Run locally:

- `uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload`

Alembic:

- `alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Initial"`
- `alembic upgrade head`
