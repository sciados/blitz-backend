## EXAMPLE: Starter User (5 Campaigns)

### Month 1: Use Base Limits
```
✓ 5 campaigns (40K words)
✓ 250 images
✓ 50 videos
Cost: $19/month
```

### Month 2: Need More Content
```
✓ 5 campaigns (base)
+ 2 extra campaigns worth:
  - 16K extra words = $1.28
  - 100 extra images = $40.00
  - 20 extra videos = $50.00
  = $91.28 overage
Total: $19 + $91.28 = $110.28
```

**No tier upgrade needed!** Just pay for what you use.

## COMPARISON

### Traditional Model
```
Free: $0 / 10K words (hit limit = can't create)
Starter: $19 / 50K words (hit limit = MUST upgrade to $59)
```

### Overage Model
```
Starter: $19 / 40K words
Want more? Pay $0.08 per 1K words
NEVER need to upgrade!
```
