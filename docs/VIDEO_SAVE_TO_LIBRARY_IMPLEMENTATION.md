# Video "Save to Library" Implementation - Complete! ✅

## Overview

I have successfully implemented the "Save to Library" functionality for videos, following the same pattern as the existing image generation workflow. This allows users to save videos to permanent R2 storage on demand, controlling storage costs while maintaining access to generated content.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Backend Changes

#### Database Schema Update
- **Migration File**: `alembic/versions/031_add_video_r2_storage_fields.py`
- **New Columns Added to `video_generations` Table**:
  - `saved_to_r2` (BOOLEAN, default FALSE, indexed)
  - `r2_key` (VARCHAR(255))

#### SQLAlchemy Model Update
- **File**: `app/db/models.py`
- **Changes**: Added `saved_to_r2` and `r2_key` fields to `VideoGeneration` class

#### API Endpoint
- **File**: `app/api/video.py`
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/video/save-to-library`
- **Function**: `save_video_to_library()`
- **Features**:
  - Downloads video from provider URL (PiAPI)
  - Uploads to Cloudflare R2 storage
  - Updates database with R2 URL and metadata
  - Sets `saved_to_r2 = TRUE`
  - Stores R2 key for future reference
  - Returns R2 URL and metadata

#### Video Library Endpoint Update
- **File**: `app/api/video.py`
- **Function**: `get_video_library()`
- **Changes**:
  - Updated SQL query to include `saved_to_r2` and `r2_key` fields
  - Updated response formatting to include these fields

### 2. Frontend Changes

#### Video Library Page
- **File**: `src/app/(dashboard)/content/video/library/page.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Added `saved_to_r2` and `r2_key` to `GeneratedVideo` interface
  - Implemented `saveVideoMutation` using React Query
  - Added `handleSaveToLibrary()` function
  - Added "Save to Library" button for videos not yet saved
  - Added "Saved to Library" indicator with checkmark for saved videos
  - Added loading state ("Saving...") during save operation
  - Added toast notifications for success/error

## How It Works

### User Flow

1. **Generate Video** (unchanged)
   - User generates video via existing workflow
   - Video stored on PiAPI's temporary URL
   - Status: `processing` → `completed`

2. **View in Library**
   - Video appears in Video Library
   - Shows "Save to Library" button (if not saved)
   - Shows "✓ Saved to Library" indicator (if saved)

3. **Save to Library** (NEW)
   - User clicks "Save to Library" button
   - Frontend calls `POST /api/video/save-to-library`
   - Backend downloads video from PiAPI URL
   - Backend uploads to Cloudflare R2
   - Backend updates database with R2 URL
   - Frontend shows success toast
   - UI updates to show "Saved to Library" indicator

### API Details

#### Save to Library Endpoint
```http
POST /api/video/save-to-library
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "video_id": 123
}
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "video_id": 123,
  "r2_key": "campaigns/456/videos/abc123.mp4",
  "video_url": "https://pub-xxx.r2.dev/...",
  "thumbnail_url": "https://...",
  "saved_at": "2025-12-09T10:30:00Z"
}
```

#### Video Library Response
```json
{
  "videos": [
    {
      "id": 123,
      "status": "completed",
      "video_url": "https://...",
      "saved_to_r2": true,
      "r2_key": "campaigns/456/videos/abc123.mp4",
      // ... other fields
    }
  ],
  "total": 10,
  "page": 1,
  "per_page": 20,
  "pages": 1
}
```

## Cost Analysis

### Storage Costs (from VIDEO_STORAGE_STRATEGY.md)
- **Users save 30% of videos** (estimated)
- **7,000 videos/month × 30% = 2,100 saved**
- **Average video size**: 10 MB
- **Total storage**: 21 GB/month
- **R2 Storage cost**: ~$0.42/month
- **R2 Bandwidth**: ~$0.17/month
- **Total**: ~$0.59/month

**Very reasonable cost!** 💰

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Run Database Migration

In production (Railway), the migration runs automatically on deployment. To run manually:

```bash
cd /path/to/blitz-backend
alembic upgrade head
```

**Note**: Requires all environment variables configured in `.env` or Railway dashboard.

### 2. Generate Test Video

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/video/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "campaign_id": "123",
    "generation_mode": "text_to_video",
    "script": "A cat playing with a ball",
    "style": "social",
    "duration": 5,
    "aspect_ratio": "16:9"
  }'
```

### 3. Check Video Library

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/video/library
```

**Expected Response**:
```json
{
  "videos": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "status": "completed",
      "saved_to_r2": false,
      "r2_key": null,
      // ... other fields
    }
  ],
  "total": 1,
  "page": 1,
  "per_page": 20,
  "pages": 1
}
```

### 4. Save Video to Library

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/video/save-to-library \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "video_id": 1
  }'
```

**Expected Response**:
```json
{
  "video_id": 1,
  "r2_key": "campaigns/123/videos/uuid.mp4",
  "video_url": "https://pub-xxx.r2.dev/...",
  "thumbnail_url": "https://...",
  "saved_at": "2025-12-09T10:30:00Z"
}
```

### 5. Verify Saved Status

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/video/library
```

**Expected Response**:
```json
{
  "videos": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "status": "completed",
      "saved_to_r2": true,
      "r2_key": "campaigns/123/videos/uuid.mp4",
      // ... other fields
    }
  ]
}
```

### 6. Frontend Testing

1. Navigate to Video Library page
2. Generate a video (or use existing completed video)
3. Verify "Save to Library" button appears for unsaved videos
4. Click "Save to Library" button
5. Verify toast notification: "Video saved to library!"
6. Verify UI updates to show "✓ Saved to Library" indicator
7. Refresh page to confirm state persists

## Files Modified

### Backend
1. `alembic/versions/031_add_video_r2_storage_fields.py` (NEW)
2. `app/db/models.py` (UPDATED)
3. `app/api/video.py` (UPDATED)

### Frontend
1. `src/app/(dashboard)/content/video/library/page.tsx` (UPDATED)

## Key Features

✅ **Matches Image Workflow**: Uses same "Save Draft" pattern as images
✅ **User Controls Storage**: Only saves videos users explicitly save
✅ **Cost Effective**: Low storage costs (~$0.60/month for 2,100 videos)
✅ **Permanent Storage**: Videos saved to R2 are permanent and reliable
✅ **Visual Indicators**: Clear UI showing save status
✅ **Toast Notifications**: User feedback on save operation
✅ **Error Handling**: Proper error messages for failed saves
✅ **Loading States**: Shows "Saving..." during operation

## Benefits

1. **Cost Control**: Users decide which videos to keep
2. **Reliability**: Saved videos are not dependent on PiAPI URLs
3. **Consistency**: Matches existing image save pattern
4. **Simplicity**: Easy one-click save operation
5. **Transparency**: Users can see which videos are saved

## Status

**✅ Implementation Complete!**

All backend and frontend changes are complete. The feature is ready for testing and production deployment.

### Next Steps

1. Deploy to Railway (migration will run automatically)
2. Test with real video generation
3. Monitor R2 storage usage and costs
4. Optionally implement auto-delete for unsaved videos after 30 days (see VIDEO_STORAGE_STRATEGY.md)

## Additional Notes

- The save operation is idempotent - clicking "Save" multiple times is safe
- Saved videos replace the provider URL with R2 URL
- R2 key follows pattern: `campaigns/{campaign_id}/videos/{uuid}.mp4`
- Videos are downloaded and re-uploaded, not moved (PiAPI URLs remain for other users)
